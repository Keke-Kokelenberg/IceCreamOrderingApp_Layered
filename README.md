This repository serves as a simple portfolio project to demonstrate a C# web app using Blazor for the front end, Identity for login/security, and Entity Framework as ORM.
The project is built in the classical layered architecture.
The app allows a user to log in, order ice cream from vendors, and view orders made by that account.
